# FlareOn4 Challenge 12: [missing]

This directory contains files that were supposed to be included as part of the FireEye solution blog.

The challenge 12 solver script expects to process a directory of flows generated by running tcpflow on the challenge pcap. Also provided is output from running the script. Package requirements are documented in-line with the import statements. Most of these are available via pip except for aplib, camellia, and vstructs (vivisect).

Enjoy.
